# ComfyUI Workshop

Welcome to the ComfyUI Workshop! This repository contains JSON workflows and output images for creating and manipulating 3D cartoons, avatars, and other media using [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI). The workflows are tailored for ASUS hardware and include configurations for various themes like cartoons, bears, space-themed characters, and more.

## Overview
This workshop provides a collection of ComfyUI workflows designed for generating and editing 3D cartoon characters, avatars, and themed visuals. The JSON files define workflows for tasks such as background removal, lip-syncing, and creating stylized avatars (e.g., bears, zombies, cyborgs). The output images demonstrate the results of these workflows.

All workflows are optimized for ASUS hardware, ensuring efficient processing for creative projects.

## Getting Started
1. *Install ComfyUI*:
   - Clone the [ComfyUI repository](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) and follow its installation instructions.
   - Ensure your system meets the requirements, particularly if using ASUS hardware for GPU acceleration.

2. *Download Workflows*:
   - Clone this repository to your local machine:
     bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/comfyui-workshop.git
     

3. *Load Workflows*:
   - Open ComfyUI and import the JSON workflow files from the repository.
   - Ensure any required models or dependencies (e.g., OpenAI TTS for OPENAI_FM_TTS_asus.json) are installed.

4. *Generate Outputs*:
   - Run the workflows in ComfyUI to generate images, videos, or audio based on the specific JSON configurations.
   - Outputs will be saved in the images/ directory or as specified in the workflow.

## Usage
- *3D Cartoon Workflows*: Use 3d_cartoon_asus.json, 3d_cartoon2_asus.json, or 3d_cartoon3_asus.json for generating stylized cartoon characters.
- *Themed Avatars*: Use BEAR_asus.json, SPACE_gorilla_asus.json, lion_men.json_asus.json, or zombie_cyborg_bust_avatar_asus.json for specific avatar styles.
- *Background Removal*: Use BG_REMOVER_asus.json to isolate subjects from backgrounds.
- *Lip-Sync and TTS*: Use lip_sync_asus.json and OPENAI_FM_TTS_asus.json for audio-driven animations.
- *Video Processing*: Use video_wan_vace_14B_v2v (2).json for video-to-video transformations.

Refer to the individual JSON files for specific node configurations and parameters.
