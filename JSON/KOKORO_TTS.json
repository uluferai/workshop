        "Trash King\nA first-generation cell phone with a dead battery, a CRT computer monitor, a sketched hard drive, a two-axis robot arm that has reached the end of its life, a fallen airplane wing, a metal prosthetic leg, a refrigerator door, and its motor—each piece forms the body parts of the Trash King. And each part reveals the king’s soul and philosophy. The scene comes to life through the wide, curious gaze of a small, orphaned girl with bare feet, shivering in the snow, who begins to talk with him... Each part of the king carries the soul of its previous owner. The setting is an ancient electronic junkyard, where each piece of the Trash King has its own life story. The little girl listens to these stories with great curiosity, unaware of her psychic powers. The CRT monitor displays an endless loop of an unfinished faulty software. The cellphone shows text messages of two separated lovers trying to reconcile. The metal prosthetic leg rhythmically swings back and forth. The robot arm with two axes repeats its motion every two minutes, and the airplane wing suddenly moves with sparks and smoke. The CRT monitor shows the moment of the plane's crash on the screen. The little girl begins to feel fear, and panic sets in. She doesn't know why she ended up in this junkyard or where she came from, due to memory loss. The plane crash is a few kilometers from the junkyard, and the little girl starts to remember that she was the only one to survive. The shock from the crash caused memory loss, and the swelling in her brain unlocked her psychic abilities. However, she has no control over these powers. Extreme fear and trauma trigger them... Suddenly, two middle-aged men, neatly dressed in suits, appear around the girl. They are the hackers who sabotaged the plane. However, the little girl is unaware of this; her parents also died in that plane crash... The hackers wear a brooch with the logo \"Signum Prime\" that shines on their collars. The little girl becomes fixated on this logo, which is deeply hidden in her memory. The hackers try to take her out of there, but the girl pushes them back with an elbow strike and suddenly starts screaming and crying. The CRT monitor starts to emit faulty signals, and the screen displays the Signum Prime logo. When the little girl sees this symbol, her fear intensifies. The Trash King suddenly speeds up its movements, and its parts begin to detach. As the parts fly in every direction, the hackers start to flee. The girl stays in place, trying to protect herself with her hands. The parts narrowly miss her, while the hackers are deeply wounded by the flying pieces. The Trash King sacrifices itself and, with one last effort, walks over the hackers and crushes them with great force. The little girl doesn’t see what happened, but she understands that the Trash King sacrificed itself. She starts walking down a seemingly endless road. Suddenly, she hears an airplane sound and looks up, smiling happily.\n"
